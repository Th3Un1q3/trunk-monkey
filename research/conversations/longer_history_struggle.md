Analyze recent commits and identify 3 biggest struggles authors had.

Trunk Monkey POC
Based on the recent commits in the codebase, I have identified the following struggles that the authors faced:

Linter Issues: Several commits were made to address linter issues in the codebase. Authors like Mikhail Gubenko and Alexey Krivitsky had to make commits specifically to fix linter problems. Mikhail Gubenko's commit message "fix linter" and Alexey Krivitsky's commit message "fixing lint issues" indicate that maintaining code quality standards set by the linter posed a challenge for these authors[1]``[2].

Wait Time in Tests: Author Arne Henrik Storm faced a struggle related to test execution timing. In one commit, they commented on the presence of a wait statement in the test code that was deemed an anti-pattern. They mentioned the need for a different approach to synchronizing test actions with the UI to avoid relying on arbitrary waits, which can lead to flakiness in tests. This struggle reflects the challenge of ensuring stable and reliable test automation in the face of timing dependencies[3].

Refactoring for Code Structure: Alexey Krivitsky had to refactor code by moving functionality from the controller to the service layer. The commit message "AssessmentHistory: moving fake code down to Service" indicates a struggle with maintaining a clean architecture and separation of concerns within the codebase. This refactoring effort suggests challenges in managing code complexity and ensuring that responsibilities are appropriately distributed across different components of the application[4].

These struggles highlight common issues faced by developers such as maintaining code quality, addressing timing dependencies in tests, and managing code structure and architecture in a growing codebase.

Make effective recommendations how to address them

Trunk Monkey POC
To address the struggles identified in the recent commits effectively, the following recommendations can be implemented:

Linter Issues:

Automated Linting: Integrate automated linter tools into the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in the development process. This can help developers address linter problems before they become a part of the codebase.
Code Reviews and Standards: Encourage regular code reviews to catch and address linter issues. Establish clear coding standards and guidelines to ensure consistency in code formatting and quality across the codebase.
Training and Education: Provide training to developers on how linters work and the importance of adhering to code quality standards. This can help developers understand the rationale behind linter rules and improve compliance.
Wait Time in Tests:

Implement Explicit Waits: Instead of arbitrary waits, implement explicit waits with conditions to synchronize test actions with the UI elements. This approach can make tests more stable and guarantee that actions are performed at the right moment.
Page Object Model: Utilize the Page Object Model design pattern to encapsulate UI elements and their interactions. This can help in reducing the reliance on waits by providing a structured approach to interacting with elements on the page.
Mocking and Stubbing: Use mocking and stubbing techniques to simulate interactions with external dependencies in tests. This can help in controlling test data and avoiding the need for long waits.
Refactoring for Code Structure:

SOLID Principles: Apply SOLID principles (e.g., Single Responsibility, Open/Closed) to guide the refactoring process. Ensure that each component has a clear and distinct responsibility to maintain a well-structured codebase.
Refactoring Tools: Utilize refactoring tools available in IDEs to assist in moving code between layers and components. These tools can help in restructuring code efficiently and safely.
Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focused on code structure and architecture. Encourage discussions on better ways to organize code and distribute responsibilities to improve the overall maintainability of the system.
By implementing these recommendations, the development team can improve code quality, enhance test stability, and maintain a modular and well-structured codebase, leading to more efficient development processes and better maintainability of the code.

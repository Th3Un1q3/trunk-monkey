   Duplication Analysis:
   There is a duplication of the add function in the commit by Alice on 2019-01-01 in utils/add.ts and in the commit by Jared on 2019-01-05 in helpers/math-operations.ts.
   Both versions of the add function have the same signature and implementation.
   Explanation:
   The duplication likely occurred due to a lack of awareness about the existing add function in the codebase.
   Alice and Jared both independently added an add function in different files without noticing the duplication.
   Recommendations:
   Addressing Duplication:
   The duplication needs to be addressed to maintain code cleanliness and avoid conflicts in the future.
   One of the add functions should be removed, and the code should be refactored to use a single shared add function.
   Responsibility:
   The responsibility to address this duplication falls on the code reviewers or team leads who should catch such redundancies during code reviews.
   They should ensure that developers are aware of the existing functionality before adding similar features.
   By addressing this duplication promptly, the codebase can be kept clean and free of unnecessary redundancies. This will also help in maintaining consistency and avoiding confusion for developers working on the project.

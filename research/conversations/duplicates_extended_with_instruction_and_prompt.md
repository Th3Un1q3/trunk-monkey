Duplication Analysis:
There is a potential duplication in the add function. It is defined in both utils/add.ts by Alice on 2019-01-02 and by Alice again in helpers/math-operations.ts by Jared on 2019-01-05.
Resolution and Advice:
Addressing the Duplication:

The duplication issue with the add function should be resolved to avoid confusion and maintain code quality.
It is recommended to centralize common functions like add to a single location to ensure consistency and prevent redundancy.
Who Should Address It:

The developers involved (Alice and Jared) should discuss and decide on the appropriate action to address the duplication.
They can choose to consolidate the add function in one place or refactor the code to eliminate redundancy.
Recommendation:

Alice and Jared should refactor the codebase to have a single definition of the add function, removing redundancy and streamlining the codebase.
By addressing this duplication, the codebase will be easier to maintain and understand, leading to improved overall code quality and fewer potential issues in the future.

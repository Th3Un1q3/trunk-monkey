# Monkey Checks

List of scenarous and checks that trunk monkey has to perform.

## Duplicated effort

While two teams work in trunk, they both start to implement required mechanisms. Without noticing it they build two parallel mechanisms. The monkey notices this emerging and coordinates teams efforts allowing them to merge the solution, as well as avoid duplicates and extra maintenance.

## Documentation missmatch

The team changes some function, performs optimisation, or simply introduces some improvement. This check verifies if documentation conflicts with the change and gives a hint on how to address it.
